# 13CO2MFA

As-yet incomplete 13CO2 carbon metabolism model. RCpp implementation of the model described by Dijkstra et al. (2011): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2010.09.022

The R script is a wrapper for the model that includes compilation via RCpp, although with some reworking it may be possible to work the model into other languages.
